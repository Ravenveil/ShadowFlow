# shadowflow/assembly — catalog-level activation and connection resolution.
# This module handles "which blocks to activate for a given goal" (ActivationSelector)
# and "how to connect them" (ConnectionResolver).
# It is NOT the runtime node-level activation (WorkflowActivationSpec in highlevel.py).
