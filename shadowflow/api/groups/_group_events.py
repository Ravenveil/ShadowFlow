"""Group chat SSE event bus — per-group in-process pub/sub.

Mirrors the approval event bus (`shadowflow.runtime.approval.service`) but
buckets subscribers by ``group_id`` so a chat room only receives its own
events. Used to push asynchronously-produced agent replies (from the
``_chat_bridge`` background task) to the browser in real time, instead of
relying on the client to poll ``GET /api/groups/{id}/messages``.

Design notes
------------
- **In-process only**: a module-level ``Dict[group_id, List[asyncio.Queue]]``.
  Under a multi-worker deployment, events published in one process won't reach
  SSE subscribers in another — the same limitation the approval / workflow SSE
  buses already have. Acceptable for the single-uvicorn-process MVP.
- **Best-effort delivery**: full queues are skipped (``QueueFull`` swallowed)
  rather than blocking the publisher (a background task that must not stall).
- **Self-cleaning**: when a group's last subscriber unsubscribes, its bucket is
  removed so the dict doesn't grow unbounded.

Event shape: ``{"id": <seq>, "type": "agent.message" | "system.notice" | "agent.typing",
"data": {...}}``. The SSE endpoint serialises ``data`` as the SSE ``data:``
line, ``type`` as the ``event:`` line and ``id`` as the ``id:`` line.

History
-------
2026-05-29 — Created for the real-chat (DM + group) work: closes the gap where
agent replies landed in the group JSON file but the UI never saw them without a
manual refresh.
2026-11-07 — Disconnect replay (mirror of Node groups-event-bus.ts): every
event gets a per-group monotonic ``id`` and replayable events land in a bounded
ring buffer so a client that lost its SSE connection can catch up via the
``Last-Event-ID`` cursor. ``agent.typing`` frames are transient (they get an
id but are never buffered). Publishing with zero subscribers no longer drops
the event — it stays in the buffer for the reconnecting client.
