"""Circuit breaker for ExternalMemoryBridge (Story 2.9, AC5 / NFR13).

Design:
  - Granularity: (agent_id, operation) — shared across sessions for the same agent.
  - Trigger: asyncio.wait_for timeout > 5 seconds.
  - Short-circuit: 60 seconds after first trip.
  - Recovery: After 60 s, the next call is allowed through (probe); if it succeeds,
    the breaker resets; if it times out again, the 60 s window restarts.

Concurrency model (Round 4 P3 follow-ups, code-review-2026-04-29 §H-A/H-B):
  - Per-key ``asyncio.Lock`` serialises state transitions and the probe-acquisition
    handshake. The lock is held only across short, non-awaiting state mutations,
    never across the protected ``coro`` itself.
  - State predicates are split:
      * ``peek_open()``    — pure read, no side effects (safe in tests / dashboards).
      * ``try_acquire_probe()`` — atomic CAS-style: returns True for at most one
        concurrent caller after the open window has expired; the loser is
        short-circuited just like in the OPEN state.
  - ``trip()`` is idempotent: if the breaker was already OPEN, no second
    ``circuit_break`` SSE event is emitted (only the *first* trip per open
    window fires the event, with the larger of the recorded ``elapsed_ms``).
  - ``CircuitBreaker._state`` lazy-insertion is now wrapped in a registry-level
    lock so the dict mutation cannot race the per-key lock-creation.

SSE events emitted (via sse_emitter callback):
  - agent.memory_bridge_circuit_break  — on first trip per open window.
  - agent.memory_bridge_circuit_recover — on successful probe after open window.
