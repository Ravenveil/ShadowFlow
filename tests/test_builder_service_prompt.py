"""tests/test_builder_service_prompt.py — T1 follow-up

Verifies that ``builder_service._build_workflow_definition`` uses the central
``SystemPromptBuilder`` instead of the legacy one-liner that dropped
responsibilities / constraints from the RoleProfile contract.

Before T1 follow-up this test FAILED because the emitted prompt was simply
``"You are Researcher. Investigates topics."`` — no responsibilities, no
constraints. After the fix the prompt is composed by SystemPromptBuilder and
contains all RoleProfile sections.
