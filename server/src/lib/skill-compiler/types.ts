/**
 * skill-compiler/types.ts — `CompiledSkill` shape (Round 4 PR-C).
 *
 * The compiler reads a verbatim `SkillReadOutput` (PR-A foundation), asks an
 * LLM whether the skill should run as a single agent or a multi-agent team,
 * and emits a `CompiledSkill` that downstream `assembler.ts` consumes at run
 * time. Compilation is a **one-time** event per skill content: the result is
 * cached under `.shadowflow/cache/skill-compile/<source_content_hash>.json`
 * and shared across every subsequent run. Goal text never participates in
 * compilation — goal is purely a run-time `user` message.
 *
 * Two execution modes:
 *   - `agent`  : single LLM with `agentConfig.system_prompt` + `tools`
 *   - `team`   : multi-agent DAG driven by `workflow/scheduler.runDag()`
 *
 * `teamConfig` is shaped to be **directly passable** to `runDag()` after
 * downstream resolution of `members_ids` into `SkillAgentDef[]`. We carry
 * `members_personas` separately so the assembler can synthesize lightweight
 * `SkillAgentDef`s on the fly when the skill bundle doesn't ship dedicated
 * `<agent>.agent.yaml` files (which is the BMAD case — agents are described
 * in prose only).
 *
 * `derivedFrom` records the provenance of the team config so the UI / future
 * cost telemetry can show "this team was inferred by LLM" vs "this team was
 * fallback-extracted from prose because LLM was unavailable".

 * Single-agent execution config.

 * `system_prompt` is the full string passed to the LLM as `system`. It is
 * pre-composed by the compiler from `raw_skill_md` + `persona` so the
 * assembler doesn't have to redo the splicing. `tools` is a whitelist —
 * empty array means "no tools" (built-in read tools always allowed at the
 * runtime layer per PR-D, but the compiled config doesn't assume that).
 *
 * `max_iterations` defaults to 50 (mirrors Claude Code's default safety cap).
 * The runtime layer reads this verbatim when wiring the tool-use loop.
