/**
 * skill-ingest/canonical-id.ts — derive a stable canonical skill id from a
 * skill source URL.
 *
 * The id is ALWAYS the last meaningful path segment of the URL (the repo slug
 * for git, the file basename stem for raw files). Callers MUST NOT supply a
 * custom id; doing so allows the same GitHub repo to be installed under two
 * different ids (e.g. `bmad` vs `bmad-method`), which pollutes the skill cache
 * and breaks team-yaml `team_ref` resolution.
 *
 * Borrowed from OpenDesign's `sanitizeRepoName` in
 *   D:/VScode/open-design/apps/daemon/src/library-install.ts (line 18-26)
 *
 * Hardenings vs OpenDesign (added 2026-05-22 after /review):
 *   - Preserve original case (do NOT lowercase). `team_ref: BMAD-METHOD` must
 *     match `.shadowflow/skills/BMAD-METHOD/` and the GitHub upstream slug.
 *   - Reject path-traversal / reserved names (`.`, `..`, ``) that pass
 *     OpenDesign's regex but would let `path.join(SKILLS_ROOT, id)` escape
 *     the skills dir. (review finding A1)
 *   - Strip GitHub `/tree/<branch>`, `/blob/<branch>/<file>`, etc URL tails
 *     so opening two different repos via "View on main" doesn't collide on
 *     id="main". (review finding A2)
 *   - Fallback id is content-addressed (sha1(url) prefix) rather than
 *     `Date.now()`, so re-running ingest with the same bad URL doesn't
 *     mint a fresh id each time. (review finding #6)
 *
 * See docs/architecture/borrowed-from-opendesign.md and
 *     docs/architecture/orchestration-transport.md for the full rationale.

/**
 * Derive a canonical skill id from a URL (git repo, raw file, or arbitrary).
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Trim. Empty / non-string → fallback.
 *   2. For GitHub-shaped URLs containing `/tree/`, `/blob/`, etc, truncate at
 *      that segment so the slug stays the `<owner>/<repo>` repo name.
 *   3. Strip a trailing `/`.
 *   4. Take the last `/`-delimited segment.
 *   5. Strip a trailing `.git`.
 *   6. Reject `.` / `..` / `` (path traversal) → fallback.
 *   7. Reject anything outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]` → fallback.
 *   8. Truncate to 64 characters.
 *
 * @param url Any URL-shaped string (we don't try to parse it as a URL — that
 *            would reject pasted-text labels, and the fallback handles garbage).
 * @returns A safe, length-bounded canonical id, never empty, never a path-
 *          traversal segment, deterministic for a given URL.
