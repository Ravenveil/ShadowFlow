/**
 * LlmCallable.ts — Transport-layer contract for "one LLM turn".
 *
 * Part of the **Orchestration ⊥ Transport** architecture documented in
 * `docs/architecture/orchestration-transport.md`. This file is the **Transport
 * layer's sole public contract**: every concrete backend (ApiClient wrapper,
 * Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, ACP, MCP, BYOK-via-OpenAI-compat) implements
 * `LlmCallable` and is invoked uniformly by the Orchestration layer
 * (`workflow/scheduler.ts`, `assembler.ts` non-team branch) through a single
 * `turn(input): AsyncGenerator<TurnChunk>` call.
 *
 * Phase 2 eng review decisions encoded here (see doc §"Phase 2 Eng Review · 决策记录"):
 *
 *   - **A1** — `turn()` always returns `AsyncGenerator<TurnChunk>`. Backends that
 *     don't natively stream (Codex CLI today) emit a single `text-delta` chunk
 *     containing the full output. Front-end typewriter UX is preserved.
 *
 *   - **A6** — O1 unified path: BOTH team-backed skills (via DAG scheduler) AND
 *     non-team skills (single turn) flow through `LlmCallable.turn()`. There is
 *     no "fast path" that bypasses this interface.
 *
 *   - **CL3 / E3** — Hybrid error model:
 *       • **Call-phase errors** (auth missing, executor not found, spawn failure,
 *         malformed input) → `throw` a typed `LlmCallError` BEFORE the generator
 *         yields its first chunk. `retry.ts` decides whether to re-invoke.
 *       • **Stream-mid errors** (provider 5xx mid-stream, CLI subprocess crash
 *         after partial output, abort signal fired) → `yield` an `error` chunk,
 *         then return. Front-end shows the error inline without hard-breaking
 *         the SSE connection.
 *
 *   - **C1** — Single `AbortSignal` propagates entry → scheduler → callable.turn()
 *     → underlying SDK/subprocess. Cancellation is end-to-end with one signal;
 *     node-level cancel is a future UI capability that will derive child signals
 *     without changing this interface.
 *
 *   - **A2 (informational)** — `capabilities` is descriptive metadata for
 *     observability and UI hints (e.g., greying out a tool-use toggle).
 *     **Orchestration MUST NOT branch on capabilities.** All callables conform
 *     to the same `turn()` contract; capability mismatches produce
 *     `LlmCallError` at call time, not orchestration branches.

 * `workspace` is the per-session artifact directory (see

 * the subprocess CWD so models can read/write artifacts via file-system tools.
 * In-process callables (ApiClient wrappers) can still use it to resolve
 * relative paths emitted in tool inputs.
 *
 * `history` is a rolling multi-turn history for backends that support it. Per
 * Phase 2 decision A2 ("artifact-based handoff"), ShadowFlow's team workflow
 * passes `history: []` between agents — coordination happens through files on
 * `workspace`, not through chat log. The field is retained for compatibility
 * with non-team / single-turn flows and for future use.
