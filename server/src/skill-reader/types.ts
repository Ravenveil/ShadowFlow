/**
 * skill-reader/types.ts — verbatim skill content shapes (PR-A foundation).
 *
 * The Round 4 architecture pivots ShadowFlow from "skill = static team yaml" to
 * "skill content (raw text) → LLM-compiled agent OR team". PR-A's job is to
 * collect the verbatim text inputs that PR-C's SkillCompiler will feed into the
 * LLM. PR-A does **not** interpret content — no agent-count inference, no
 * workflow ordering, no persona extraction. Just classify files into three
 * buckets (agent / workflow / doc) by their on-disk location and keep the raw
 * bytes intact for downstream LLM consumption.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - `raw` field is byte-equal to `fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf-8')`. PR-C
 *     tests assert this (golden file invariant).
 *   - `frontmatter` is gray-matter parsed for `.md` files only; YAML files
 *     keep `null` (PR-C parses them as a whole if needed).
 *   - `path` is always relative to `skillDir` (POSIX `/` separator) so the
 *     hash is stable across Windows / Linux.
 *   - `content_hash` covers every (path, raw) pair sorted by path. Any byte
 *     change anywhere busts the cache. This is what PR-C uses as its compile
 *     cache key (`source_content_hash`).
 *
 * Out of scope for PR-A:
 *   - Agent persona extraction (PR-C)
 *   - Workflow DAG parsing (PR-C)
 *   - team-vs-agent decision (PR-C)
 *   - LLM calls of any kind
